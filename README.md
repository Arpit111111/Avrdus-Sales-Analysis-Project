# Avrdus-Sales-Prediction-using-SARIMA-Project
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting sales data for Avrdus, a fictional retail business, using advanced time-series techniques like SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). The objective is to extract actionable insights and build a forecasting-ready model by applying data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

The dataset includes transactional information such as order date, product details, customer info, region, units sold, revenue, and profit.


# Project Objective
- Analyze monthly revenue trends and the impact of discounts
- Identify top-performing product categories and their sales behavior
- Understand geographical performance across locations
- Assess time-series behavior for forecasting using SARIMA
- Build a robust predictive model using SARIMA to forecast future sales


# Dataset
- <a href="https://github.com/Arpit111111/Avrdus-Sales-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Avrdus_sales_data.csv">Dataset</a>

# Key Business Questions / KPIs
- What is the sum of final price and discount by month?
- What is the total sales by category?
- What is the final price and discount by category and quantity sold?
- What are the final price and discount trends by category and location?
- What are the autocorrelation patterns in the sales data?
- What does the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) reveal about lag influence?
- Is the time-series data stationary? (ADF Test)
- What are the total monthly sales?
- What is the total number of orders by location?
- What is the total sales and final price by month?
